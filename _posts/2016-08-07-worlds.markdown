Team Canada’s world junior men’s team was rounded out May 20-22 in Winnipeg (MB) when the Winnipeg Squash Racquet Club hosted Squash Canada’s World Junior Men’s Team trials. 

Underdog Ravi Seth from Elora, Ontario won the World Junior Men’s Team trials to capture a spot on Team Canada for Poland this summer.  Unseeded Ravi won his two pool matches 3-0 to set up a final match against top seed Matt Henderson from Victoria, BC.

Although leading in each of the first two games, Seth lost both and went 2-0 down to Henderson.  Seth then went on an incredible run to win 33 of the next 40 points, taking the next two games to level the match at 2 games all, and then to win the 5th comfortably 11-3.

Team trials results can be viewed <a href="../assets/files/trials.pdf" target="_blank" title="trials results">here</a>.

Ravi Seth follows in his brother Cameron’s footsteps who made the Junior World Team back in 2012.

Henderson earned his spot on count back; he and Seth join 2016 Canadian U19 Men’s Champion Mike Mehl (AB) and Rahul Sehrawat (ON) to make the 4-person Team Canada squad.  Mehl and Sehrawat qualified for the team as points leaders accumulated in 3 (of a possible 4) selection events over each of the last two seasons.

Team Canada will compete at this summer’s WSF World Junior Squash Championships being held in Bielsko-Biała, Poland from August 6-17.
