Life travels fast, and car crashes can happen in the blink of an eye, but with our companion, Red Eye, we can prevent this. Long and tedious drives can increase the risk of falling asleep at the wheel and medical emergencies don't wait until you're out of the car. This Android app is designed to create a more positive, seamless driving experience by helping drivers when they are tired or in the event that they have a medical emergency while behind the wheel.

The app uses face detection to track and analyze the driver's face, identifying if they have fallen asleep or have experienced a medical emergency through their eyes (whether they are opened or closed). The app then suggests a course of action: find the nearest hotel or alert the authorities. If the former is chosen, a list of nearby hotels will appear on screen, if the latter is chosen, the authorities will be alerted and given the exact coordinates by accessing the phone's location.
